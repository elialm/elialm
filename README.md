Hi, my name is Elijah, but my handle on Github is @elialm. I'm a student of software 
engineering in the Netherlands.

My interests lie mostly in everything embedded or wherever I can program low level, although 
I enjoy some casual Python scripting. My especiality is in C, but I can work work with
some managed languages: C#, Python, Java. I can work in C++, although I don't quite enjoy
the experience.

My current learning endeavors are focussed on (C)GB assembly and Rust. I'm still facinated 
by assembly code every day and had the luck to stumble on the reference for the Gambeboy system,
so I really had no choice but to go ahead and prototype some stuff. I'm interested in learning
Rust, since it appears to be a language where I can more easily do complex stuff in compared to C
and it seems like a better alternative than C++.

I'm still new to working on Github, but I'm down to help a project if I can benefit from it.
I use open source software every day, so I would like to give back to the community if I can.

The best way to reach me is via my email: ealmeidacoimbra@gmail.com. Alternatively, you could
try my [LinkedIn page](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/elijah-almeida-coimbra-204225194), although
I am less active there.
